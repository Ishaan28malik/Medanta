<li>
The NorthCap University was founded in 1996, to promote excellence in Technical and Management education by Educate India Society, registered under the Registration of Societies Act of 1860.
</li>
<li>
The University was conceived as Institute of Technology and Management in response to the acute deficiency of centres of higher learning in the country as also, the need to develop relevant human capital to meet the technology and management challenges of the 21st century.
</li>
<li>
The founders had a clear and well defined mission - to build an unaided, self - financed University committed to delivering education of internationally recognized standards, a University that would go on to serve as an intellectual resource base in India and the sub-continent.
